![cpc vision model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flrngel/cpc-tensorflow/master/resources/cpc-vision.png)

Tensorflow implementation of **Representation Learning with Contrastive Predictive Coding**

- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03748)
- [My Notes](https://github.com/flrngel/understanding-ai/issues/24)

## Features
- Resnet101

## Status

training code is very messy right now. there is hard codes.. WIP

I just tested vision part but `model.py` is intend to adopt various domain.
